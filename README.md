## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a web application for reviewing restaurants and their offerings. Users can create, update, and view restaurant profiles, which include information such as name, cuisine, location, and ratings. Users can also leave reviews for restaurants, rating them on criteria such as food quality, service, ambiance, and overall experience. The application helps users make informed decisions about where to eat and provides feedback to restaurant owners to improve their offerings.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your system:

- MERN
- MUI 
- GITHUB


### Installing

Open the terminal on your local machine.

Navigate to the directory where the food review app is located.

Run the command npm install to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

After the installation is complete, run the command npm start to start the development server.

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000. Open your web browser and go to this URL to access the application.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Currently, there are no tests for this project. If you plan to add tests, explain how to run them here.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Non-registered users can view restaurant profiles and reviews but cannot edit or delete them. They can click the "Like" button on reviews.
Registered users can create new restaurant profiles, leave reviews, and edit or delete their own reviews. They can also upload images of the food.
Use the navigation links to switch between different pages and features of the application, such as browsing through the list of restaurants and their associated reviews.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

- Ensure that you have met all the prerequisites mentioned above.
Set up your production environment, such as a VPS or a hosting platform that supports Node.js.
Configure your production environment with the required environment variables (e.g., database connection details).
Transfer the application files to the server and run npm install to install dependencies.
Verify that the application runs successfully in the development environment.
Create an account on Vercel and create a new project.
Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
Configure the required environment variables in Vercel.
Deploy the application manually or wait for the automatic deploy to run.
Verify that the application runs successfully on the Vercel platform.
